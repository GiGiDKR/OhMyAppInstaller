# OhMyAppInstaller

An application that installs software not available through package managers.

> [!NOTE]
> This software is integrated into my global project [OhMyTermux](https://github.com/GiGiDKR/OhMyTermux) : with the possibility to install a Debian proot-distro with XFCE and by default OhMyAppInstaller with shortcut on the desktop.
