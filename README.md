# OhMyAppInstaller

**An application that installs from a selection software not available through package managers.**

This project is adapted from [App-Installer](https://github.com/phoenixbyrd/App-Installer) by [Phoenixbyrd](https://github.com/phoenixbyrd).

Currently the only changes are changing the scripts to download the latest available version and not a defined version.

> [!NOTE]
> This software is integrated into my global project [OhMyTermux](https://github.com/GiGiDKR/OhMyTermux) with the possibility to install a Debian proot-distro with XFCE.
> 
> By default OhMyAppInstaller shortcut is available on the desktop.
